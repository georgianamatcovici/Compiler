This project implements a custom programming language using YACC/Bison for syntax parsing and C++ for semantic analysis and execution. The language supports fundamental programming constructs, including:

Type Declarations: int, float, char, string, bool, and array types.

Classes: Class definitions in the global scope with fields, methods, and object initialization.

Control Structures: if, for, while statements.

Expressions: Arithmetic and boolean expressions with an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for evaluation.

Functions: User-defined functions and two built-in functions: Print(expr), TypeOf(expr).

Symbol Table: Scope management for global, block, function, and class scopes.

Semantic Analysis: Ensures type safety, variable/function declaration checks, and function parameter validation.

AST Evaluation: Arithmetic and boolean expressions are evaluated using an AST structure.
Final Grade: 10/10 üèÖ
